var A = Rand(8,12)

def inc5(x: Double) = x+5



var A5 = A map inc5   // map a function

var A5m = -A5  // unary minus

var A10 = 10*A  // 10 is converted to a RichNumber and then the multiplication with the Array[Array[Double]] is performed

var A20 = A*20.0  // A is converted to a RichDouble2DArray and then multiplication is performed
