This is the executable of ScalaLab, that contains:

1. the executable ScalaLab212.jar 
2. Windows and Unix scripts for executing ScalaLab using
 appropriate JVM options that configure also the native BLAS libraries, and Java 3d native support,
use the one appropriate for your system.


Note that the server JVM can sometimes execute some computational tasks significantly faster.

3. the lib folder that contains the whole 
 Scala 2.12 distribution binaries plus ScalaLab specific scientific 
 libraries.
4. the defaultToolboxes folder, is for placing user toolboxes in order to 
installed automatically on startup.
5. the Abbreviations.txt file defines useful abbreviations that can be used from the ScalaLab editors.

The best scripts for running ScalaLab seems to be:

 Linux64RunScalaLabServerJVM.sh  // for Linux 64 bit, MacOSX and other Unix based
 Win64RunScalaLabServerJVM.bat   // for Windows 64 bit

ScalaLab is developed with JDK 8 and therefore problems can occur 
from earlier JDK versions.


 
Thank you, for using ScalaLab!
